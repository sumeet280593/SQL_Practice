--- To create a new table
create Table employee(
    emp_id INT,

    salary INT
);

--- Query all the records from table
select * from employee;

--- Insert single record in the table
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(10, 'Amit', 25, 20000);

--- Insert Multiple record in the table
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(20, 'Rahul', 28, 25000),
                    (30, 'Raj', 32, 40000),
                    (40, 'Ajay', 34, 28000),

                    (60, 'Yash', 44, 60000);

--- Insert record in the table by another way using column name
INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, salary, emp_name) VALUES(70,45000,'Sumeet');

--- Insert multiple records in the table by another way using column name
INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, salary, emp_name) VALUES(80,40000,'Pankaj'),
(90,60000,'John'), (1000,50000,'Mike');

--- To update any value in the column
UPDATE employee SET age = 30 WHERE emp_name = 'John';

--- To delete any row in the column
DELETE FROM employee WHERE emp_id = 1000;

create Table employee2(
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    salary INT
);

--- To drop table from database/schema
DROP TABLE employee1;


select * from employee;

--- Ques 1) Query emp name whose age is less than 30
select emp_name from employee where age < 30;

--- Ques 2) Query all columns whose emp salary is less than 50000 and age is greater than 30

select * from employee where salary < 50000 and age >30;

--- Ques 3) Query employee name, age and salary whose emp salary is less than 50000 
---         or age is greater than 30

select emp_name, age, salary from employee where salary < 50000 OR age > 30;

--- Ques 3) Query employee name, age and salary whose emp salary in range 30000 to 50000 
---         and age in range 30 to 40

select emp_name, age, salary from employee 
where (salary between 30000 and 50000) 
and (age between 30 and 40);

--- Query all employees whose age is not defined
select * from employee where age is NULL;

--- Query all employees whose in age column null is not present
select * from employee where age is NOT NULL;

--- Query maximum salary of the employee
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) from employee);

--- Query 2nd maximum salary of the employee

--- Method 1
SELECT * from employee 
where salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee where salary not in 
                (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee)
                );

-- Method 2
SELECT * from employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
